# Cheat Sheets
This folder contains cheat sheets prepared by different authors

1. [Cheatsheets-ai](https://github.com/kailashahirwar/cheatsheets-ai) contains essential cheat sheets for deep learning and machine learning researchers. This cheat sheet was inspired by [Kailash Ahirwar](https://github.com/kailashahirwar). 
2. [Github-Cheat-Sheet:](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet) A collection of cool hidden and not so hidden features of Git and GitHub. This cheat sheet was inspired by [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman)'s [Git and GitHub Secrets](http://confreaks.tv/videos/aloharuby2012-git-and-github-secrets) talk at Aloha Ruby Conference 2012 (slides) and his More Git and GitHub Secrets talk at WDCNZ 2013 ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/holman/more-git-and-github-secrets)). 

## Git Cheat Sheet & Useful Facts About Git


Git Commands  | Description
--------------|------------
git init | Create a new Git repository
git config --global user.name "name" | Sets the name you want to attach to your commit transactions 
git config --global user.email "email address" | Sets the email you want to attach to your commit transactions 
git config --global alias.arbitrary_name "command name" | Change the "command name" to arbitrary_name
git config --global core.editor "editor_name" | Set up your editor to "editor_name", e.g., "nano", "vim", etc. 
git add "file_name" | Add the file to staging index
git add . | Add all files from working directory to staging index
git status | List all new or modified files to be committed
git commit -m "message" | Add files from staging index to repository committed by the "message"
git commit --amend -m "new_message" | Change the commit message by using the amend flag
git diff | View difference between staging index and working directory
git diff "SHA1 hash" | Show changes between the working tree and the index or a tree, changes between the index and a tree, changes between two trees, or changes between two files on disk
git diff --staged | View difference between HEAD and staging index
git diff HEAD | View difference between HEAD and working directory
git diff --color--words branch1..branch2 | Show differences between branch1 and branch2 using color fonts
git diff [first-branch]...[second-branch] | show diffrence between 2 branches
git branch "branch_name" | Create a branch whose name is "branch_name"
git branch --m "old_name" "new_name" | Change the old name of the branch to new one 
git branch --d "branch_name" | Delete the branch
git branch | List branches
git branch -m "new" | Rename current branch to "new"
git checkout "branch_name" | Switch to "branch_name"
git checkout -b "branch_name" | Create the branch and switch to this branch
git checkout remotes/origin/"branch_name" | Switch to a remote "branch_name"
git checkout -- "file_name" | Discard changes in the working directory. Here -- means to stay in the same branch which  confirms that "file_name" is not the name of a branch otherwise it switches to "branch_name"
git checkout "SHA1 hash" -- "filename" | Switch to a specific commit (determined by SHA1 hash). This command is safe and does not overwrite local changes in the working directory. Here HEAD is not detached because of "--".
git merge "branch_name" | Incorporate changes from the named commits (since the time their histories diverged from the current branch) into the current branch
git log | Show committed files
git log --oneline | List one commit per line and it shows the first 7 characters of the SHA1 hash and the commit message
git log > file.txt | Save git log as file.txt
git log --follow "filename" | show the history of "filename" 
git log --since=2017-09-08 | show all commits since date 
git log --untile=2018-05-10 | show all commits untile date
git log --author="Author's Name" | show all commits of "Author's Name"
git log -n1 | show just the last commit
git log -n2 | show the last two commits
git log --grep="filename or partly name " | show just the commit about filename or partly name
git reflog | See what other commits your HEAD has pointed to in the past. This is useful when we lose some new commits using checkout to past commits
git ls-tree "branch_name" | List the contents of "branch_name", like SHA1 hash 
git rm "filename" | Remove  "filename"
git rm -r "foldername" | Remove  "foldername"
git mv "old filename" "new filename" | change name file
git mv "old filename" "name directory"/"new filename" | change directory and change name file
git reset --soft "SHA1 hash" | Reset the place of HEAD pointer and does not touch the index file or the working tree at all. Also, move the files (after new HEAD pointer place) from repo to staging index
git reset --mixed "SHA1 hash" | Reset the place of HEAD pointer. Reset the index but not the working tree (i.e., the changed files are preserved but not marked for commit) and reports what has not been updated
git reset --hard "SHA1 hash" | Make your current branch (typically master ) back to point at SHA1 hash and make the files in your working tree and staging index the same as the versions committed in the SHA1 hash
git reset HEAD "file_name" | Unstage "file_name"
git reset HEAD^ | Pop your last commit out of the history
git tag | List all tags
git remote -v | List the URL of the remote repo
git remote add origin "URL"  | Associate your repo with remote 
git remote set-url origin "URL" | Update an existing remote
git push -u origin "branch_name" | Push "branch_name" to remote
git push --force-with-lease | Force with lease gives you the flexibility to override new commits on your remote branch, whilst protecting your old commit history
git pull origin "branch_name" | Pull the most recent changes from that remote branch
git fetch origin | Downloads new data from a remote repository. But it does not integrate any of this new data into your working files.
git clone "URL" | Copy a repo from URL
git revert HEAD | Revert the previous commit
git rebase origin_branch | Merge in the requested branch (origin_branch in this case) and apply the commits that you have made locally to the top of the history without creating a merge commit 
git submodule add URL/User_name/module_repo name_repo | Add an existing Git repo (module_repo) of a user (User_name) as a submodule of the repo that you are working on. **Note that after implementing this command we should use two more commands "git add ..." and "git commit -m ..." to add the submodule to the former repo.** 
<br>

* Note that origin should be replaced with remote address if remote was not added. 
* Git's push --force is destructive because it unconditionally overwrites the remote repository with whatever you have locally. Instead of git push --force option, use git push --force-with-lease. See this article from [Atlassian](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/04/force-with-lease/).
* Note that the command **git checkout "SHA1 hash"** switches to a specific commit (determined by SHA1 hash) and **detached HEAD because there is no branch. When HEAD is detached, then it is necessary to point pointer to a branch by running: "git rebase HEAD branch_name" OR "git checkout old_branch_name" OR "git checkout -b new_branch_name"**. 

### Aliases

Alias | Code (Should be Run in Terminal) | Description
------|----------------------------------|------------
git logg | git config --global alias.logg "log --graph --decorate --oneline --abbrev-commit --all" | Display a graphic and readable log on one line using various colours
git pushf | git config --global alias.pushf "push --force-with-lease" | Force with lease gives you the flexibility to override new commits on your remote branch

### Setup a Git Credential Helper
Rather than entering your GitHub username and password every time you push, you can setup a Git credential helper to manage this for you.

OS | Command 
---|--------
MAC | git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
Linux | git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'

Once a credential helper is enabled, the next time you git push, you will add your credentials to the helper.
