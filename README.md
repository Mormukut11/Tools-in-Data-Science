## Git
[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is [easy to learn](https://git-scm.com/doc) and has a [tiny footprint with lightning fast performance](https://git-scm.com/about/small-and-fast).

## Python Libraries for Data Science:
Python continues to take leading positions in solving data science tasks and challenges. [Kdnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/06/top-20-python-libraries-data-science-2018.html) introduced 20 libraries of Python for data science. Here are five of the most important of libraries: 

### Numpy:
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.<br>
